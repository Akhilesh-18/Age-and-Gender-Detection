# Age and Gender Detection 
Age and gender are two of the most important facial characteristics, and since they are so fundamental to social interactions, estimating them from a single face image is a critical task in intelligent applications like access control, HCI, law enforcement, marketing intelligence, and visual surveillance, among others.

In this Python project, we'll use deep learning to precisely determine a person's gender and age from just one snapshot of their face. The Tal Hassner and Gil Levi-trained models will be used. The projected gender is either "Male" or "Female," and the predicted age is either within one of the following age ranges: 0 to 2, 4 to 6, 8 to 12, 15 to 20, 25 to 32, 38 to 43, 48 to 53, or 60 to 100. Due to elements like cosmetics, lighting, obstacles, and facial expressions, it is quite challenging to determine an exact age from a single image. Therefore, rather than treating this as a regression problem, we turn it into a classification challenge.

In the end we can impot the images or we can track the age and gender in live with the help of Open CV. In this project I have downloaded the images from the Internet and subjected the input image to the trained data 

NOTE:
The output may not be accurate for some images.
